# Minions Paradise — Open Paradise

Welcome to the **Minions Paradise** preservation and modification project. This repository contains the client-side code and server-side infrastructure required to run a custom version of EA's *Minions Paradise* (v5.3.x).

## Project Overview

This project aims to revitalize the game by removing its original reliance on external EA servers and `.unity3d` asset bundles. The client has been modified to load assets directly from local storage, and a custom Flask server provides all necessary backend services.

### Key Modifications
- **Local Asset Loading**: Assets are now loaded from `Minionsparadise/Assets/resources/content`, bypassing the need for remote bundle downloads.
- **Custom Backend**: A Python/Flask private server replaces the original EA backend, offering persistent saves, economy management, and social features.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Designed to run on modern development environments with a flexible reverse-proxy setup for mobile testing.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

### 🏝️ [Minionsparadise]
The core Unity 5.3 project.
- **Assets**: Contains all scripts, UI definitions, and game resources.
- **Scripts**: Extensive C# modifications to support local I/O and custom server communication.
- **FMOD**: Integrated audio project for game sounds and music.

### 🖥️ [SERVER]
A Flask-based private server implementations.
- **routes/**: API endpoints for game state, user profiles, sales/marketplace, and TSE events.
- **utils/**: Database handlers (SQLite), profile generation, and logging utilities.
- **marketplace/**: Definitions for in-game shop items and promotional offers.
- **nopromousers.txt**: A list of UIDs for which promotional offers are restricted.

### 📚 [DOC]
Technical documentation and guides.
- **API_Reference.md**: Documentation of the internal server endpoints.
- **Admin_Guide.md**: Instructions for server maintenance and user management.
- **IO_Replacements.md**: Details on how the Unity asset loading was retrofitted.

### 🛠️ Utilities
- **config-switcher.py**: A GUI utility to toggle between local and public server configurations for both the Unity client and the Flask server.

## 🛠️ TODO List


### High Priority

- [ ] **Script for Unity 6 porting creation.** I need you to see the changes made in the Unity 5 version and port them in the Unity 6 port in C:\Unity\UNITY6, see if the changes in the fork 
I always update the Unity 5 version first, and I know there are significant differences between the Unity 5 and Unity 6 versions in terms of assets. However It has to focus on the code only when it comes to syncs between Unity versions. 
    I would need a tool/or you to do the work to see the changes since the last commit inside the Unity 6 version, ignoring all sorts of assets, of course. Basically sync everything that can be synced without too many issues between Unity versions. 

Also I need you to clone the development branch into main, since I tried to pull request development into main but it says : 
"There isn’t anything to compare.
main and Development are entirely different commit histories.". Please fix this issue. I need a development branch, and a main branch, main containing only stable changes, that I put development inside once the changes are stable. 

    

- [ ] **REBUILD FMOD PROJECT TO ADD CUSTOM AUDIO LOOPS**: Currently using raw banks extracted from the game.
- [ ] **TeamOrderBoard no audio**: Stuart performance after order completion is missing sound (FMOD event missing).


### Features & Infrastructure
- [ ] **TSE Logic Expansion**: Improve The Social Event (TSE) team systems and invitation reliability.
- [ ] **Global Chat Polish**: Enhance the in-game chat interface and server-side message history management.

### Maintenance
- [ ] Improve server-side logging for better debugging of client networking issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Server**: Navigate to the `SERVER/` directory and run `python kampai_server.py`.
2. **Client**: Open the `Minionsparadise/` folder in Unity 5.3.5p4. Use the custom build pipeline to prepare the assets. Note that there are different branches for different versions of the game. There is a Unity-2017 branch for later Unity versions, as well as a development branch where I put the latest development progress. 
3. **Deployment**: For mobile testing, use the `reverse-proxy-client.bat` to route traffic from your device to the local server. (frp fast reverse proxy)
